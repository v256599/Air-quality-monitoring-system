## Abstract
This project implements a fully functional digital clock system using VHDL, designed to operate on the Nexys A7 FPGA development board. The clock features multiple operating modes, including standard time display, stopwatch functionality, and date management (day, month, year). Users can interact with the system through push-buttons to switch modes, set time and date values, and control the stopwatch. The design includes multiple subsystems such as clock dividers, counters, mode selectors, and multiplexed 7-segment display drivers, all integrated under a top-level digital clock module. Comprehensive testbenches were developed for each module to ensure correct functionality before system-level integration.

## The main contributions of the project are:
Implementation of a fully functional digital clock system on the Nexys A7 FPGA, featuring clock, stopwatch, and date functionalities.
Design and integration of modular VHDL components with full user interaction through push-buttons and visual feedback via LEDs and 7-segment displays.
Complete functional verification using individual testbenches for each module and successful top-level system integration and simulation.
